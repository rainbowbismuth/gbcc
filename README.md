# gbcc

This was an experiment in designing a [Hoopl](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hoopl)-like library in Rust. 

In the main branch is a standard take that uses basic blocks, but in the `pc` branch there was the start to a version that had no basic blocks, and worked by rewriting instructions or replacing them with sub-graphs.
